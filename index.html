                <h2>About Me | </h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Ali Mohamed Abdi. I am studying app development at Seattle Central College.

                After completing my diploma, I went straight to college, and while in college, I got a job in
                    Management. 

                My work experience has disciplined me to take my responsibilities very seriously.

                I am currently a student in the Year Up program working towards acquiring my certifications in
                    software and web development.

                I consider myself to be a leader while also having a great experience in managing. I am wired to be
                    competitive and passionate in achieving the most out of everyone in whatever task I am given. </p>

                <h2>The Journey | </h2>
                <p>
                    My love for computers travels as far as I can remember. When most people make that statement, their love references the excitement
                    that runs through us when we use these machines. Of course I felt the same way but my adoration went furthure then that. I was 
                    astonished by how such a thing works and the magical secret. Eventually I came across programming in the 7th and thats when I knew
                    I wanted to be a programmer when I grow up. I studied many programming languages such as C++, C#, PHP, and Phyton.  
                    However at the time I didn't consider it as a career because for me it was a passion and a hobby. It wasn't until I got to college
                    when I decided I wanted to be a web developer and that's when I learned HTML and CSS along with Javascript. Since then I have dedicted
                    much of my time to being proficient at HTML, CSS and Javascript.

                <h2>Year Up | </h2> 
                <p>
                    My obession with technology would eventually lead me to a program called Year Up.
                    Year Up is an intensive, competitive technical training and career development program. 
                    The program includes college-level courses, professional training and a six-month internship.
                    The program offers an app development track and for that reason I decided to enroll.
                    Right now in the program in the process of completing coursework in Software Development and Testing, 
                    Project Management, and Business Communications, with specialized training in Application 
                    Development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have learned a great deal while in the Year Up
                    program. From improving on public speaking and communications, to learning Git command line, and GitHub.
